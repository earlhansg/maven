# TestNG Tutorial with MAVEN

## TestNG Assert Class

- TestNG asserts are the most frequently used methods in TestNG
- TestNG asserts are used to decide whether the test was successful or not, along with the exceptions
- so far, we have seen Junit Asserts, and TestNG Asserts are very similar, but there are a few reasons we use TestNG (explained on the next slide)
- the key thing to understand at this points is that TestNG has its own Assert tools

## JUNIT vs TESTNG

- both frameworks have parameterized tests, timeout feature and exception tests (both frameworks have several similarities)
- but TestNG has some more advanced features, and it is also possible to do more than unit testing

## JUnit

- installed by default in your IDE
- configuration done only from Jave test classes
- no group functionality
- no dependency functionality
- need to install a report tool
- limited list (but still useful) annotations

## TESTNG

- must be installed by the user
- test suite configured through the testng.xml file
- create groups of tests that belong to different classes through the "testng.xml" file
- depedency tests (command: "dependsOnMethod")
- HTML reports generated by default
- more extensive list of usable annotations

## Just Remember
- that as we are using a TestNG framework going forward, we will be using the TestNG Assert tools instead of the Junit Assert tools
- they work in a very similar way
- its main purpose is to determine if a test step has passed or failed
- when we import the Assert class, we will be using the one from the TestNG library
