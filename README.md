# TestNG Tutorial with MAVEN

## What are Reports?

- they are a document that we can use to review how our test have performed
- for example, we may want a nice overview to see what test have passed or failed
- but for the failed test, we will want to see at what step the test fail at
- reports are important because they provide both technical and non-technical people a way to interpret the results
- TestNG provides a test report but we will be looking at more advanced reports later in the course
